## 2024-01-04: Unified Agent Architecture Implementation

### Changes Made
- Refactored agent system to use a unified Agent class instead of separate Coder and ProjectManager classes
- Implemented role-based behavior through JSON configuration files
- Created base interfaces and abstract classes for the backplane system
- Added Redis implementation of the backplane for agent communication
- Implemented proper cleanup and connection management for Redis clients

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Role-Based Architecture**
   - Moved from inheritance-based to composition-based design
   - Roles are defined in JSON files with clear responsibilities and capabilities
   - Single Agent class interprets role definitions at runtime

2. **Backplane System**
   - Abstract Backplane interface defines core communication capabilities
   - RedisBackplane implementation provides reliable message passing
   - Proper connection lifecycle management with cleanup

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Integration tests verify role-specific behavior
   - Shared backplane instance between tests
   - Increased timeouts for Claude API calls

### Benefits
- Easier to add new agent types by just creating role definitions
- Better separation of concerns between agent behavior and communication
- More maintainable codebase with less duplication
- Cleaner testing with proper resource management

### Next Steps
- Add more role definitions for specialized agents
- Implement role-specific tool sets
- Add validation for role definition files
- Consider adding role inheritance/composition
