## 2025-01-05: Memory Integration and Metrics Enhancement

### Changes Made
1. Enhanced Agent system with memory integration:
   - Added Memory system for context persistence
   - Integrated RoleLoader for dynamic role loading
   - Added metrics tracking for agent performance
   - Updated agent configuration to include memory and roleLoader

2. Updated testing infrastructure:
   - Added metrics integration tests
   - Enhanced agent integration tests with memory
   - Added memory operation logging
   - Improved test coverage for role-based behavior

3. Enhanced demo implementation:
   - Added shared memory between agents
   - Improved role-based task execution
   - Added metrics tracking and reporting
   - Enhanced error handling and recovery

### Technical Details
- Agent configuration now includes memory and roleLoader:
  ```typescript
  interface AgentConfig {
    rolePath: string;
    tools: Tool[];
    claude: ClaudeClient;
    backplane: Backplane;
    memory: Memory;
    roleLoader: RoleLoader;
  }
  ```
- Memory system provides:
  - Short-term and long-term memory storage
  - Relevance-based retrieval
  - Automatic memory consolidation
  - Vector store integration

### Testing
- Added new integration tests for:
  - Memory operations and persistence
  - Metrics tracking and reporting
  - Role-based memory context
  - Agent performance monitoring

### Next Steps
1. Enhance Memory System:
   - Implement distributed memory storage
   - Add cross-agent memory sharing
   - Create memory optimization routines
   - Improve memory pruning strategies

2. Complete Context System:
   - Implement context pruning
   - Add vector store integration
   - Create context search capabilities
   - Enhance context summarization

3. Improve Documentation:
   - Add API documentation
   - Create setup guides
   - Write usage examples
   - Add troubleshooting guides

## 2025-01-04: Role-Based Agent System Implementation

### Changes Made
1. Refactored agent system to use role-based behavior:
   - Removed specialized agent implementations (Coder.ts, ProjectManager.ts)
   - Enhanced base Agent class to adapt behavior from role definitions
   - Added role validation and proper error handling
   - Improved prompt generation with role capabilities and tools

2. Updated role definitions:
   - Added structured capabilities with descriptions
   - Added tools with descriptions
   - Added role-specific instructions
   - Created consistent format across all role files

3. Enhanced logging system:
   - Implemented singleton pattern for global logger
   - Added role validation error logging
   - Enhanced logging with role-specific metadata
   - Added comprehensive test coverage

### Technical Details
- Role definitions now follow a strict interface:
  ```typescript
  interface RoleDefinition {
    name: string;
    description: string;
    responsibilities: string[];
    capabilities: Record<string, string>;
    tools: Record<string, string>;
    instructions: string[];
  }
  ```
- Roles are loaded from JSON files and validated at runtime
- Agent behavior adapts based on role capabilities and tools
- Logging system provides detailed insights into agent operations

### Testing
- Added comprehensive integration tests for:
  - Role-based agent behavior
  - Agent initialization and execution
  - Role validation and error handling
  - Logging system functionality

### Design Decisions
1. **Single Agent Class**: Instead of specialized agent classes, we use a single Agent class that adapts its behavior based on role definitions. This makes the system more maintainable and extensible.

2. **Role-Based Configuration**: Roles are defined in JSON files, making it easy to add new agent types without code changes. The role definitions include:
   - Capabilities with descriptions
   - Available tools
   - Specific instructions
   - Responsibilities

3. **Enhanced Prompts**: The agent now generates more detailed prompts that include:
   - Role description and responsibilities
   - Available capabilities and their descriptions
   - Available tools and their purposes
   - Role-specific instructions

4. **Improved Logging**: The logging system now provides better insights into:
   - Role initialization and validation
   - Task execution and completion
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Agent operations and state changes

### Benefits
1. **Extensibility**: New agent types can be added by creating role definition files
2. **Maintainability**: Single Agent class reduces code duplication
3. **Flexibility**: Roles can be modified without code changes
4. **Observability**: Enhanced logging provides better system insights
5. **Type Safety**: Strict interfaces ensure role definition correctness
6. **Memory Persistence**: Agents maintain context across tasks
7. **Performance Tracking**: Built-in metrics for monitoring and optimization

### Known Issues
None at this time. All tests are passing and the system is functioning as expected.
