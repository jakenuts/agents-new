# Developer Log: Ax Framework Demo Implementation

## Project Overview
Created a demonstration of the Ax framework's capabilities by implementing a collaborative agent system that generates a TypeScript application.

## Implementation Decisions

### Architecture
- Chose to separate concerns between project management and coding tasks
- Implemented a tools layer that both agents can access
- Used a test-output directory to isolate generated code

### Agent Design
1. Project Manager Agent
   - Uses generic types `ProjectManagerInput` and `ProjectManagerOutput` for type safety
   - Implements task dependency management
   - Maintains state through `currentPlan` property
   - Provides methods for task status updates and retrieval

2. Coder Agent
   - Uses generic types `CoderInput` and `CoderOutput` for type safety
   - Implements file generation capabilities
   - Supports multiple task types (setup, core functionality)
   - Includes placeholders for AI-driven code generation

### Tools Implementation
- Created a modular tools system with:
  - File operations (read, write, list)
  - Web request capabilities
  - Error handling and type safety
  - Async/await pattern for all operations

## Technical Decisions

1. TypeScript Configuration
   - Used ES2022 target for modern JavaScript features
   - Enabled strict mode for better type safety
   - Configured for ES modules

2. Project Structure
   - Separated source code from generated output
   - Maintained clear separation of concerns
   - Used .js extension in imports for ES modules compatibility

3. Error Handling
   - Implemented consistent error response types
   - Added success/error flags in responses
   - Included detailed error messages

## Future Improvements

1. Agent Capabilities
   - Implement AI-driven code generation
   - Add more sophisticated task planning
   - Enhance code review capabilities

2. Tools Enhancement
   - Add file watching capabilities
   - Implement caching for file operations
   - Add more sophisticated web tools

3. Testing
   - Add unit tests for agents
   - Implement integration tests
   - Add test coverage reporting

## Lessons Learned

1. Framework Insights
   - Ax framework requires careful type management
   - Agent communication needs clear interfaces
   - Tool implementation should be generic and reusable

2. Implementation Challenges
   - Managing type safety across agent interactions
   - Handling asynchronous operations consistently
   - Structuring the project for clarity and maintainability

3. Best Practices
   - Use clear type definitions
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation
   - Follow consistent coding patterns
