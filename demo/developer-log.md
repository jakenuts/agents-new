## 2024-01-03: Role-Based Agent System Implementation

### Major Changes

1. **Role-Based Architecture**
   - Moved from specialized agent classes to a unified Agent class with role-based behavior
   - Created JSON-based role definitions that specify capabilities and instructions
   - Roles define behavior through text descriptions rather than code
   - Added role loading and validation system

2. **Communication Backplane**
   - Implemented distributed communication system using Redis
   - Added message broker for agent communication
   - Created context sharing mechanism
   - Added agent discovery service
   - Implemented heartbeat and cleanup mechanisms

3. **Agent Improvements**
   - Enhanced context management with branching support
   - Added role-based decision making
   - Improved message handling with role-aware responses
   - Added cleanup and resource management

### Current Architecture

│   └── base/           # Core agent functionality
│       ├── Agent.ts    # Unified agent implementation
│       ├── Context.ts  # Context management
│       └── Memory.ts   # Memory system
├── roles/             # Role definitions
│   ├── coder.json     # Software engineer role
│   └── project-manager.json  # Project manager role
└── backplane/         # Communication system
    ├── base.ts        # Base backplane interface
    └── redis/         # Redis implementation
```

### Role Definition Structure

Roles are defined in JSON files with the following structure:
```json
{
  "name": "RoleName",
  "description": "Role description",
  "responsibilities": [
    "List of key responsibilities"
  ],
  "capabilities": {
    "capability_name": "Detailed description of capability"
  },
  "tools": {
    "tool_name": "Description of how the tool should be used"
  },
  "instructions": [
    "Specific guidelines for the role"
  ]
}
```

### Communication Flow

1. Agent Registration:
   - Agents register with discovery service on initialization
   - Capabilities and tools are published
   - Heartbeat mechanism maintains active status

2. Message Routing:
   - Messages are sent through backplane
   - Role-based message handling
   - Context sharing for collaboration

3. Context Management:
   - Contexts can be branched for collaboration
   - Automatic summarization and pruning
   - Distributed context synchronization

### Next Steps

1. **Role Enhancements**
   - Add more specialized roles (Reviewer, Documentation, etc.)
   - Enhance role capabilities with more detailed instructions
   - Create role templates for common patterns

2. **Backplane Improvements**
   - Add support for more message patterns (pub/sub, request/reply)
   - Implement message routing based on capabilities
   - Add support for other backends (RabbitMQ, etc.)

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Add role validation tools
   - Implement monitoring and debugging tools

### Usage Notes

1. **Creating New Roles**
   - Define role in JSON format
   - Focus on clear capability descriptions
   - Provide specific usage instructions for tools
   - Test with existing agents

2. **Agent Communication**
   - Use message-based communication
   - Share context when needed
   - Consider message priority and deadlines
   - Handle failures gracefully

3. **Tool Integration**
   - Define clear tool interfaces
   - Include usage descriptions in roles
   - Consider approval requirements
   - Track resource usage

### Known Issues

1. Context pruning needs optimization for large histories
2. Role loading could be more efficient
3. Need better error handling for network issues
4. Memory management needs improvement for long-running agents

### Future Considerations

1. **Scaling**
   - Implement load balancing
   - Add support for agent pools
   - Optimize resource usage

2. **Security**
   - Add authentication/authorization
   - Implement secure communication
   - Add audit logging

3. **Monitoring**
   - Add performance metrics
   - Create monitoring dashboard
   - Implement alerting system

4. **Integration**
   - Add support for external services
   - Create API endpoints
   - Add webhook support
