# Autonomous Agent System Implementation Plan

## System Overview

The autonomous agent system is a TypeScript-based framework for creating AI agents that can maintain context, manage memory, and execute complex tasks through a combination of planning and execution. The system consists of several key components working together to enable intelligent, context-aware agents.

### Core Components

1. **Context Management System**
   - Maintains conversation and action history
   - Handles thread-based context organization
   - Provides automatic summarization and pruning
   - Manages metadata and references

2. **Vector Store Integration**
   - Enables semantic search across context
   - Supports multiple backend options
   - Handles embeddings for context nodes

3. **Memory System**
   - Long-term storage of important information
   - Relevance-based retrieval
   - Automatic consolidation of similar memories

4. **Agent Framework**
   - Base agent capabilities with tool integration
   - Role-based agent specialization through text definitions
   - Communication backplane for agent coordination
   - Planning and execution logic

   - Write usage examples
   - Add troubleshooting guides

## Technical Requirements

- TypeScript 4.x+
- Node.js 16+
- Vector store backend (configurable)
- Claude API access for embeddings and completions
- Redis for message broker and context management
- Proper error handling and type safety
- Efficient memory usage and cleanup
- Robust testing coverage

## Design Principles

1. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript typing for all components
2. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between components
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new capabilities and integrations
4. **Performance**: Efficient memory and CPU usage
5. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery
6. **Maintainability**: Clear code organization and documentation
7. **Distributability**: Support for distributed agent deployment
8. **Security**: Secure communication and access control

## Notes

- The system should be able to handle long-running conversations and tasks
- Memory management is critical for preventing resource exhaustion
- Type safety must be maintained throughout the system
- Each component should be independently testable
- Documentation should be maintained alongside code
- Agents should be deployable as independent microservices
- Communication backplane enables distributed coordination
- Role definitions allow easy addition of new agent types
