# Autonomous Agent System Implementation Plan

## System Overview

The autonomous agent system is a TypeScript-based framework for creating AI agents that can maintain context, manage memory, and execute complex tasks through a combination of planning and execution. The system consists of several key components working together to enable intelligent, context-aware agents.

### Core Components

1. **Context Management System**
   - Maintains conversation and action history
   - Handles thread-based context organization
   - Provides automatic summarization and pruning
   - Manages metadata and references

2. **Vector Store Integration**
   - Enables semantic search across context
   - Supports multiple backend options
   - Handles embeddings for context nodes

3. **Memory System**
   - Long-term storage of important information
   - Relevance-based retrieval
   - Automatic consolidation of similar memories

4. **Agent Framework**
   - Base agent capabilities with tool integration
   - Role-based agent specialization through text definitions
   - Communication backplane for agent coordination
   - Planning and execution logic

## Current Focus

The current implementation focus is on the Agent Framework and Communication Backplane:
1. Implementing distributed agent communication
2. Creating shared context management system
3. Setting up agent discovery and coordination
4. Developing secure message routing

## Recent Achievements

1. **Role-Based Agent System**
   - Implemented text-based role definitions
   - Created role loading and validation
   - Refactored agent system to use role capabilities
   - Removed specialized agent implementations in favor of role-based behavior

2. **Agent Communication**
   - Designed message-based coordination
   - Implemented basic agent collaboration
   - Added context sharing capabilities
   - Created role-aware message handling

## Next Steps

1. Implement Communication Backplane
   - Design and implement message broker
   - Create distributed context management
   - Add agent discovery service
   - Set up secure communication

2. Complete Context System
   - Finish context pruning
   - Add vector store integration
   - Implement context search

3. Enhance Memory System
   - Implement distributed memory storage
   - Add cross-agent memory sharing
   - Create memory optimization routines

4. Improve Agent Framework
   - Add more sophisticated planning
   - Enhance role interpretation
   - Implement advanced coordination patterns

## Technical Requirements

- TypeScript 4.x+
- Node.js 16+
- Vector store backend (configurable)
- Claude API access for embeddings and completions
- Message broker system (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ)
- Distributed storage solution
- Proper error handling and type safety
- Efficient memory usage and cleanup
- Robust testing coverage

## Design Principles

1. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript typing for all components
2. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between components
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new capabilities and integrations
4. **Performance**: Efficient memory and CPU usage
5. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery
6. **Maintainability**: Clear code organization and documentation
7. **Distributability**: Support for distributed agent deployment
8. **Security**: Secure communication and access control

## Notes

- The system should be able to handle long-running conversations and tasks
- Memory management is critical for preventing resource exhaustion
- Type safety must be maintained throughout the system
- Each component should be independently testable
- Documentation should be maintained alongside code
- Agents should be deployable as independent microservices
- Communication backplane enables distributed coordination
- Role definitions allow easy addition of new agent types
