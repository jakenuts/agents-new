# Autonomous Agent System Implementation Plan

## System Overview

The autonomous agent system is a TypeScript-based framework for creating AI agents that can maintain context, manage memory, and execute complex tasks through a combination of planning and execution. The system consists of several key components working together to enable intelligent, context-aware agents.

### Core Components

1. **Context Management System**
   - Maintains conversation and action history
   - Handles thread-based context organization
   - Provides automatic summarization and pruning
   - Manages metadata and references

2. **Vector Store Integration**
   - Enables semantic search across context
   - Supports multiple backend options
   - Handles embeddings for context nodes

3. **Memory System**
   - Long-term storage of important information
   - Relevance-based retrieval
   - Automatic consolidation of similar memories

4. **Agent Framework**
   - Base agent capabilities
   - Specialized agent types (Coder, ProjectManager)
   - Tool integration system
   - Planning and execution logic

## Current Focus

The current implementation focus is on the Context System, specifically:
1. Fixing type safety issues in metadata handling
2. Implementing thread archival system
3. Adding context optimization routines
4. Creating efficient summarization logic

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Context System implementation
2. Begin Vector Store integration
3. Start Memory System implementation
4. Create base Agent framework

## Technical Requirements

- TypeScript 4.x+
- Node.js 16+
- Vector store backend (configurable)
- Claude API access for embeddings and completions
- Proper error handling and type safety
- Efficient memory usage and cleanup
- Robust testing coverage

## Design Principles

1. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript typing for all components
2. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between components
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new capabilities and integrations
4. **Performance**: Efficient memory and CPU usage
5. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery
6. **Maintainability**: Clear code organization and documentation

## Notes

- The system should be able to handle long-running conversations and tasks
- Memory management is critical for preventing resource exhaustion
- Type safety must be maintained throughout the system
- Each component should be independently testable
- Documentation should be maintained alongside code
